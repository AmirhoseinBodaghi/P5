An Analysis on Newly Emerged Rumors on Twitter
This is an eleven-stage project that has been devised to first make a newyly-emerged rumor dataset out of Twitter and then do a set of analysis (Micro + Macro) on it. These eleven stages (from S4 to S14), each one comes with a distinct python code with the following short decription for each one :
S4 : This code crawls the tweets related to the rumor we want to hunt. But prior to the running of the code we should have made a Twitter API so the API keys be set in the code. Also we would need to set the queries (key words related to the rumor) in the code, so to capture only those tweets that include the queries. The output which is the collection of all tweets related to the rumor will be ready in a .jsonl file.
S5 : This code by getting the S4 output as its input, seperates the data into meaningful pieces of information and then organizes them in an excell file. This excell file assigns one distinct row for each tweet and save its information (including tweet ID, User ID, Date amd Time and ...) in the columns.
